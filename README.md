The repository contains source code and data for the article, [Deep-learning-powered data analysis in plankton ecology](https://arxiv.org/).

## Description

We provide examples of how to use deep learning for plankton data analysis. The examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks and can be run on Google Colab. The examples are divided into three categories:

- `detection-tutorials`: For plankton detection from microscopy videos
- `segmentation-tutorials`: For plankton segmentation and classification from microscopy images
- `trajectory-tutorials`: For plankton trajectory linking from microscopy videos

## Usage

### Detection-tutorials

We provide three examples of plankton detection from microscopy videos using deep learning. The examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks and can be found in [detection-tutorials](https://github.com/softmatterlab/Deep-learning-in-plankton-ecology/tree/main/detection-tutorials) folder. The pdf versions of the notebooks are included for quick preview. Alternatively, the notebooks can be run on Google Colab by clicking on the links below:

<!--
The examples can be run on Google Colab. The notebooks can be run on a local machine by installing the following dependencies: -->

<!-- We provide ready-to-use code for the following tasks:

- Plankton detection (Under the folder `Detection-examples`)
- Plankton segmentation and classification (Under the folder `Segmentation-examples`)
- Plankton trajectory linking (Under the folder `Trajectory-examples`)

Google colab links for the respective examples will be added shortly. -->
