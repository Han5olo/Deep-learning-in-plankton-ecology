# Deep-learning-powered data analysis in plankton ecology

By Harshith Bachimanchi, Matthew I. M. Pinder, Chlo√© Robert.

The repository contains source code and data for the article, [Deep-learning-powered data analysis in plankton ecology](https://arxiv.org/)

## Description

We provide examples of how to use deep learning for plankton data analysis. The examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks and can be run on Google Colab. The examples are divided into three categories:

- Plankton detection
- Plankton segmentation and classification
- Plankton trajectory linking

## Installation

The examples can be run on Google Colab. The notebooks can be run on a local machine by installing the following dependencies:

<!-- We provide ready-to-use code for the following tasks:

- Plankton detection (Under the folder `Detection-examples`)
- Plankton segmentation and classification (Under the folder `Segmentation-examples`)
- Plankton trajectory linking (Under the folder `Trajectory-examples`)

Google colab links for the respective examples will be added shortly. -->
